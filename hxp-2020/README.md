**Disclaimer**: we didn't solve any of these during the CTF proper but were persistent enough to solve them afterwards. *Huge* thanks to the organizers for making it possible:
  * they provide [a VM with the challenges](https://ctf.link/) for anyone to download (btw, we encourage you to download it and get acquainted with the challenges before reading the writeups).
  * they set up a server equivalent to the CTF setup just for us, so that we could test our exploits against the real CTF setup.
